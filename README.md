# Coin Change
This is a simple, recursive solution to the [coin change problem](https://www.techiedelight.com/coin-change-problem-find-total-number-ways-get-denomination-coins).
It finds the number of ways to create a certain sum given an unlimited supply of coins of given denominations.
For example, one could ask how many ways there are to get 2 Euro using the available Euro coins (2 € and 1 € as well as 50 ct, 20 ct, 10 ct, 5 ct, 2 ct and 1ct, where 1 € == 100 ct).

## Build & use
Download and build using Visual Studio 2017 with the C++ Desktop development installer option enabled.
Use the Test Explorer Window to run unit tests. Before running tests, make sure that you have the correct platform selected.
	Go to Test > Test Settings > Default Processor Architecture and make sure that the selected option is the same as your build platform (x86 or x64)
The built-in performance test will never fail, but it will output the runtime of the algorithm to the console (in Test Explorer, select Output).
Refer to the accuracy tests to test the correctness of the algorithm.
